# Rule: Create GitHub Release from Recent Commits

**Description:** This rule automates the process of creating a GitHub release based on commits since a previous reference point (tag or commit hash). It generates basic release notes, creates the release using the GitHub CLI, and verifies the post-release workflow status.

**Inputs:**

*   `NEW_VERSION`: The version tag for the new release (e.g., `v1.3.1`).
*   `PREVIOUS_REF`: The tag or commit hash representing the start point for the release notes (e.g., `v1.3.0` or `551551ff`).
*   `RELEASE_TITLE`: The title for the GitHub release (e.g., `"v1.3.1 - Better Tool Errors & Docs"`).

**Steps:**

1.  **Get Target Commit SHA:**
    *   Determine the commit hash for the release target (usually HEAD).
    *   *Successful Command:*
        ```bash
        git rev-parse HEAD
        ```
    *   Store this SHA for the `--target` argument later. Let's call it `TARGET_SHA`.

2.  **Generate Raw Commit Log:**
    *   Get a list of commit messages between the previous reference and HEAD.
    *   *Successful Command:*
        ```bash
        git log <PREVIOUS_REF>..HEAD --pretty=format:"%h %s" | cat
        ```
    *   *(Replace `<PREVIOUS_REF>` with the actual previous tag/commit)*.

3.  **Format Release Notes (Manual/Template Step):**
    *   Take the raw commit log from Step 2 and format it into Markdown.
    *   *Example Structure (based on our final notes):*
        ```markdown
        # iOS Simulator MCP <NEW_VERSION>

        ## Improvements

        - **Improved Tool Invocation Error Identification:** Enhanced the system...

        ## Documentation

        - **Added MCP Server Badge:** Included a badge...
        - **Added Security Policy:** Introduced a `SECURITY.md` file...
        - **Added License File:** Included the MIT License file...

        ## Build

        - **Version Bump:** Updated the project version to <NEW_VERSION>.
        ```
    *   *(This step often requires manual curation to group related commits and write clear descriptions)*.

4.  **Create Temporary Notes File:**
    *   Save the formatted markdown notes from Step 3 into a temporary file (e.g., `TEMP.md`). This avoids shell quoting/escaping issues.
    *   *Conceptual Command (adapt as needed):*
        ```bash
        # (Create the file TEMP.md with the content from Step 3)
        echo -e "..." > TEMP.md
        ```
    * STOP and ask the User to review before proceeding

5.  **Create GitHub Release:**
    *   Use the `gh` CLI to create the release, referencing the temporary notes file.
    *   *Successful Command Structure:*
        ```bash
        gh release create <NEW_VERSION> --target <TARGET_SHA> --title "<RELEASE_TITLE>" --notes-file TEMP.md --latest
        ```
    *   *(Replace `<NEW_VERSION>`, `<TARGET_SHA>`, and `<RELEASE_TITLE>` with the actual values)*.

6.  **Clean Up Temporary File:**
    *   Remove the temporary notes file.
    *   *Successful Command:*
        ```bash
        rm TEMP.md
        ```

7.  **Check Workflow Status:**
    *   Verify the status of the most recent workflow run (often triggered by the release).
    *   *Successful Command (with correct quoting for `jq`):*
        ```bash
        gh run list --limit 1 --json name,status,conclusion,event,url --jq '.[0]' | cat
        ```
    *   Check the `conclusion` field in the output (should ideally be `success`).
