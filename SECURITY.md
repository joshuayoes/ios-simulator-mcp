## Fixed Vulnerabilities

### Command Injection (Fixed in v1.3.3)

**CVE**: To be assigned  
**Severity**: Moderate  
**Fixed in**: v1.3.3 (2025)

**Description**: Previous versions contained command injection vulnerabilities in several MCP tools (ui_tap, ui_type, ui_swipe, ui_describe_point, ui_describe_all, screenshot, record_video, stop_recording) due to unsafe shell command construction using string interpolation.

**Impact**: Malicious input could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

**Fix**: Replaced unsafe `execAsync` string interpolation with secure `execFile` calls using argument arrays. Added input validation.
